# Fablesphere-Source
This project was my first finished game after countless prototypes.
My blog can be found in here: https://dmrdev1.wordpress.com/2023/05/31/fablesphere-breakdown/
This game roughly contains around 15k lines of code,
All the system are seperated into folders, hope you find this interesting.
